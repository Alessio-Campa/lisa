# Referencing LiSA in your workspace

| **Goal:** using a precompiled official release of LiSA as a dependency of your project |
| **LiSA release used:** 0.1b2 |
| **Estimated time:** 5 minutes |
| **Required tutorials:** [Build LiSA from source](building.md) |
| **Requirements:** [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/it/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html), a build tool of your choice (the tutorial will use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)) |
| **Note:** you should directly reference LiSA projects only if you plan to work with an unreleased version of LiSA. If you want to use LiSA as-is instead, please refer to the [Using a precompiled LiSA release](maven-dependency.md) tutorial instead. |
